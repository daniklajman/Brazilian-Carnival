		<h1>Espírito Santo</h1>

		<p>The Carnival in Vitória are performed one week before Carnival, more precisely in Sambão do Povo. The schools are responsible for choosing their own themes, which usually revolve around historical happenings or some sort of cultural or political movement.</p>

		<p>The most famous (and usually the winners) samba schools are Unidos de Jucutuquara, MUG, Andaraí, Independentes de Boa Vista, and Novo Império.</p>

		<p>More than the traditional school parade, the carnival in Espirito Santos includes a large set of attractions, especially in the beach areas of the state, from north to south.</p>
