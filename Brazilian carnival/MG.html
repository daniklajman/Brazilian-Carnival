		<h1>Minas Gerais</h1>

		<p>Minas also holds some important carnival parades in Belo Horizonte and the historic cities of Ouro Preto, Mariana, São João del Rei, and Diamantina. They are held mostly by students' houses, which attract a majority of young people from the neighbor states. There are also other major parades in the region, such as the one in Pompéu.</p>

		<p>Carnival in Minas Gerais is often characterized by blocos carnavalescos with varying themes and costume styles, almost always accompanied by a brass and drums band. However, Minas Gerais carnival was first influenced by the Rio de Janeiro Carnival (several cities have their own samba schools). Later, some Axé groups from Bahia came to play in the state every carnival season.</p>

		<p>The first carnival party in Belo Horizonte happened in 1897, even before the inauguration of the city. Carnival was very popular until the 1990s. After almost 20 years, a party resurfaced in 2009, with blocos carnavalescos in protest against mayor Marcio Lacerda. The party was growing every year only with popular initiative.</p>

		<p>In 2017, Belo Horizonte had the largest carnival in its history and the third largest in Brazil. There were more than three million people on the streets, with about 500,00 tourists. The Baianas Ozadas block hit a record audience of 500,000 people.</p>

		<p>The Carnival of the city of Ouro Preto is very popular with college students in the area. The city has a large proportion of students, who during the year live in places called Repúblicas (a rented house maintained and ruled by themselves). During carnival, the Repúblicas are literally packed with residents and many visitors coming from all over the country. The hills prevent traffic of heavy sound trucks, but don't stop people from feasting all night and day.</p>
